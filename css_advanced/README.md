# CSS Advanced Project

Welcome to the **CSS Advanced Project**, part of the ALX Front-End Curriculum. This project focuses on applying advanced CSS styling techniques to an HTML page based on a Figma design.

## ðŸŽ¯ Objective

The main goal of this project is to take a pre-defined HTML structure and apply CSS styling that matches a professional Figma design layout. You will practice using:

- Flexbox and Grid for layouts
- Custom fonts (Source Sans Pro, Spin Cycle OT)
- Responsive design techniques
- Hover effects and UI/UX principles
- Precise spacing, sizing, and colors based on Figma

## ðŸ§© Files Included

- `index.html`: The HTML structure of the page (based on provided boilerplate)
- `styles.css`: All CSS styling should be written here (create this file)
- `images/`: Folder with all images used (logos, icons, etc.)
